# @gracile-labs/functional

Lightweight hooks and context primitives for signal-based render trees.  
Works anywhere a render function can be scoped, with Lit or similar templating libraries.  
Uses the TC39 Signal Proposal for its backend.

> NOT FOR PRODUCTION!  
> It's an experiment to see how far we can go.

## üß† Why

Web development is increasingly polarized around two powerful patterns:

- **Immutable, top-down render trees**
- **Reactive primitives** (known as "Signals"), which enable fine-grained updates

It's a simplification. In practice, there is overlap, and not all systems were designed with Signals as their foundation. Also, both approachs are valid and boils down to developer preference, context, and technical limitations.

Templating libraries like `lit-html` historically gives you efficient top-down rendering via tagged template literals, while signal-based systems give you surgical reactivity.  
In the original `lit`/`lit-html` model, Custom HTML Element acts as "relays", where you can stuff all the reactive primitives, methods, and any intricate stuff you need to build an app. `lit-html` templates are "stateless", deterministic (theoretically).  
That's was a feature, not a limitation.

However, a recent breakthrough was the integration of the TC39 Signal Proposal in a Lit friendly `@lit-labs/signals` package, which unlock an hybrid solution. You can still use the familiar, and easy to mindmap vertical data stream, but also avoid endless prop. drilling when needed, thanks to Signal aware template expressions.

That being said, you'll soon be tempted to do something `LitElement` was invented for, which is adding **self-contained state** to pieces of reusable unit ("Web Component" / "Custom Element" / "React FC"‚Ä¶):

```ts
const count = signal(0); // <-- Outside of the render tree. You're fine :)

function Counter() {
  const count = signal(0); // <-- Inside the render tree. Oh no :(

  return html`
    <button @click=${count.set(count.get() + 1)}>Clicked ${count} times</button>
  `;
}

html`<div>${Counter()}</div>`;
```

**You don't want to do that**. The official way to create a Signal is _outside_ of a the render tree, otherwise it will be recreated on each `render` call. It's not like Solid-js, which was designed **solely** with signal primitives and JSX pre-compilation in mind.

> Also, at the time of writing, official examples are featuring `LitElement` as a "Signal Host" thanks to a `SignalWatcher` Mixin.  
> While you can use the good old `render` function for Light DOM with a `SignalHost` and pure `lit-html` (no required Custom Element host), it's less straightforward than relying on the `@lit-labs` package, off-the-shelf Mixin. Moreover, you might encounter bugs with stratified SSR scenarios. It's still an experimental package after all, and the Lit team is collecting feedback.

So what do we need to author those self-contained "Component", _√†-la_ React, Preact, Vue-Vine‚Ä¶ you name it?

This is where `@gracile-labs/functional` is coming into play.  
This library is providing the ergonomics of `useState`, `createEffect`, and `useContext` without locking you into a full framework. It's mostly a facade for the Signal polyfill and the Lit Signals helpers (mixin, html tag‚Ä¶), or any custom, signal-aware templating implementation.

It works with:

- Custom JSX runtimes (e.g. JSX + tagged templates)
- Template literal systems like `lit-html`.
- Returned in Lit‚Äôs `render()` method (shadow DOM or light DOM)
- Anything else that follows the `render(host, fn)`, top-down model

All that by avoiding heavy or redundant machinery. It just collect and offload the reactivity work the the Signals scheduler, in a colocated fashion.

The API is purposefully kept as minimal as possible.

## üß™ How it works

`@gracile-labs/functional` scopes state and side-effects to the current **render host** ‚Äî any object passed to `withFunctional(host, renderFn)`. This lets you:

- Reuse `useState()` and `useContext()` safely across renders
- Scope reactive effects to a host's lifecycle
- Test hook logic without needing DOM APIs or `HTMLElement` interfaces
- Compose functional components with consistent reactivity

## üöÄ Quickstart (w. LitElement + Lit Signals)

```tsx
import { WithFunctional, useState } from "@gracile-labs/functional";
import { SignalWatcher } from "@lit-labs/signals";
import { html, LitElement } from "lit";

@customElement("counter-button")
export class CounterButton extends WithFunctional(SignalWatcher(LitElement)) {
  render() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return html`
      <button @click=${() => setCount(count.get() + 1)}>Count: ${count}</button>
    `;
  }
}
```

## üß± API

### `withFunctional(host, () => TemplateResult)`

Establishes a render scope where `useState`, `createEffect`, and `provideContext` work.

### `WithFunctional(BaseClass)`

Mixin for Lit-style components ‚Äî auto-wraps `render()` with `withFunctional(this, ...)`.

### `useState(initial: T): [Signal.State<T>, (value: T) => void]`

Reactive local state. Value is a `Signal.State<T>`, compatible with Lit‚Äôs reactivity system.

### `createMemo(fn: () => T): Signal.Computed<T>`

Signal-aware memoization ‚Äî returns a computed signal. Recomputes when tracked signals change.

### `createEffect(fn: () => void | () => void)`

Runs after render. Cleanup is run on re-render or unmount. Equivalent of `useEffect()`.

### `onMount(fn)`, `onCleanup(fn)`

Shorthands for post-render effect logic.

### `createContextProvider<T>(defaultValue: T): [Provider, useContext]`

Creates a scoped context system.

## üß© Advanced Use (Light DOM)

```tsx
<FunctionalComponents>
  {() => (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Child />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )}
</FunctionalComponents>
```

**Light DOM reactivity in production builds is experimental** due to current limitations in `@lit-labs/signals`:

- `watch()` directives may fail when code is minified (private names)
- Custom `SignalHost` objects may not be recognized in production

**Use CE + Shadow DOM for now** as a safe baseline.

## üß™ Testing Hooks

You can test everything without Lit, DOM, or browser:

```ts
const host = {};
const result = withFunctional(host, () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(1);

  setCount(2);

  return count.get();
});
```

<!-- ## üîç Reactivity Model Comparison -->

<!-- | Framework | Reactive Core          | Rendering Approach          | Notes                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| React     | VDOM + hooks           | Full VDOM diffing           | Third parties experimental signals        |
| Vue 3     | Signals (`ref`) + VDOM | VDOM + fine-grained patches | Hybrid; dependency tracking optimized |
| SolidJS   | Signals only           | Compile-time template       | No VDOM; ultra-fine-grained           |
| Angular   | Signals (v17+)         | Zone-less + signal views    | Emerging hybrid; no zones required    |
| Svelte    | Compiler reactivity    | DOM mutations at compile    | Reactive declarations, not signals    |
| Lit       | Manual `Signal` + DOM  | Tagged template literal     | Surgical reactivity via signals       | -->

## üì¶ Install

```bash
pnpm add @gracile-labs/functional
```

## In-depth

The hook set API philosophy aligns with React's `use*`, but it could have been Solid's `create*`.

<!-- Gracile Functional is:

- Host-bound (like React)
- Sync-only (like Solid)
- Render-tracked (like React)
- Non-dependency-tracked effects (like Solid) -->

It looks like React but behave closer to Solid in places.
